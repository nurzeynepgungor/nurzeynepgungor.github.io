				<h1> Interactions between BNST and the central amygdala (CeA) </h1>				

				<p> Early work stressed the differential involvement of the CeA and BNST 
				in the genesis of fear versus anxiety, respectively. It was hypothesized that 
				BNST mediates sustained anxiety-like responses to diffuse environmental threats, 
				as opposed to the CeA, which generates defensive behaviors in response to imminent 
				threats (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19595731">Walker et al., 2009</a>). 
				Although this model became extremely influential, accumulating evidence 
				suggests that BNST’s influence is not limited to the generation of 
				anxiety-like responses but that it also shapes responses to discrete threatening stimuli. 
				Therefore, a thorough understanding of fear/anxiety generation can only be reached 
				by understanding BNST-CeA interactions.</p>

				</div>

				<p>We started to study BNST-CeA interactions by characterizing the projections 
				from BNST to CeA. It was known that most BNST cells are GABAergic except for a small population of
				glutamatergic cells in the ventral part of BNST (BNST-AV). 
				We used a double viral strategy to drive expression of ChR2 
				in BNST cells that project to CeA. In vitro recordings showed that most of the 
				light-evoked responses were inhibitory; revealing that the 
				glutamatergic cell population in BNST-AV contributes little projections to CeA. 
				This experimental paradigm also enabled us to investigate the local 
				connectivity in BNST. Interestingly, in BNST-AV, connections from CeA-projecting 
				to non-CeA targeting cells in BNST were distinctively low, 
				suggesting independent processing networks may exist in BNST-AV.  </p>

				<h1>Contrasting the properties of glutamatergic and GABAergic BNST-AV neurons</h1>
				<p>As noted above, most BNST cells are GABAergic. However, a small population of 
				glutamatergic cells exists in BNST-AV. Importantly, there is evidence
				that the two cell types exert opposite influences on negative emotional states 
				(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19494154">Radley et al., 2009</a>;
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23515155">Jennings et al., 2013</a>): 
				GABAergic cells reduce, whereas glutamatergic cells increase fear/anxiety. 
				Intriguingly, despite being few in number, the influence of glutamatergic cells on behavior seems to 
				dominate.</p>

				<p class="caption2"> <i>Spontaneous firing exhibited by a glutamatergic cell.</i></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="project_content">
				
				<p> This information led us to investigate the properties of these two cell types 
				using various techniques. Do the afferent and efferent connections of the 
				glutamatergic and GABAergic cells differ? Are there differences in their 
				intrinsic electrophysiological properties, morphology, or responsiveness to noradrenaline?<p>

				<h3>CGRP effects on BNST-AL neurons</h3>
				<p> BNST has direct projections to autonomic and neuroendocrine regulatory 
				structures of the brain which are thought to evoke fear and anxiety-like behaviors.  
				Furthermore, most BNST cells are GABAergic and are expected to inhibit their targets. 
				In contrast with this, infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) into BNST
				was reported to activate BNST targets and potentiate anxiety 
				(<a href="https://www.ncbi.hlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21289190">Sink et al., 2011</a>).</p>
				
				<p>In this project, we investigated the effects of CGRP on anterolateral 
				BNST (BNST-AL) neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in vitro. 
				We found that CGRP postsynaptically increases the inhibitory inputs evoked by 
				electrical stimulation of the stria terminalis, one of the main input pathways to BNST. 
				In contrast, CGRP has no effect on excitatory inputs. Thus, our findings suggest that CGRP 
				potentiates anxiety-like behaviors and increases neural activity in BNST targets by 
				inhibiting BNST-AL cells. </p>

				<h3>Interactions between the insular cortex and BNST-AL</h3>
				<p>There is ample evidence suggesting corticotrophin releasing (CRF) cells in 
				BNST-AL are anxiogenic. However, it is unclear which structures “inform” 
				CRF cells of threatening environmental contingencies. For instance, the oval nucleus 
				(where CRF cells are concentrated) is devoid of inputs from basolateral amygdala, 
				subiculum or medial amygdala, in contrast to other BNST subnuclei. However, the oval 
				nucleus receives selective viscerosensory afferents from the anterior and middle 
				insular cortex.</p>

					<img class="row_pic2" src="figures/ALBNSTAxons.jpg">
					<p class="caption2"> <b>Top:</b><i>ChR2 and GFP expressing insular cortex axons in BNST-AL.</i><br/>
					<b>Bottom:</b> <i>Light-evoked (1 Hz) excitatory potentials in BNST-AL.</i></p>
				</div>
				<p>The anterior insular cortex (in contrast to its gustatory posterior counterpart) has been 
				implicated in a wide range of complex behaviors, as well as negative emotions 
				(for reviews on human studies: 
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19096369">Craig, 2009</a>;  
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23294552">Feinstein, 2013</a>). 
				Therefore, we set out to characterize the interactions between the insular cortex and BNST. First we 
				tested the effects of anterior insular lesions in behavioral tests that are known 
				to involve BNST activity like contextual fear conditioning and exposure to elevated 
				plus maze. However, ibotenic lesions did not affect performance. On the other hand, 
				there is evidence that both BNST and anterior insular cortex lesions decrease 
				inhibitory avoidance, suggesting this behavioral paradigm is a good candidate 
				to study insular cortex-BNST/oval nucleus interactions. </p>
